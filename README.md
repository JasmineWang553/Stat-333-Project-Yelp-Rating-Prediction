# Stat-333-Project-Yelp-Rating-Prediction -- Multiple Linear Regression
- **Intro**: Yelp is a site where users can write online reviews for places they visit. 
- **Goal**: We are given data that includes each reviewâ€™s text, as well as several other characteristics of each review. We are aiming to use a sample of Yelp restaurant reviews to produce a model that will allow us to predict the star ratings of other Yelp restaurant reviews. Although there are better ways to make predictions, such as machine learning, this class focuses on regression analysis, therefore we decided to use multiple linear regression. In order to minimize the mean square error, we also performed feature extractions from comments of the users. 
- **Tech used**: Multiple Linear Regression, k-fold Cross Validation, R
